Click on an image to select a cat to memory.  Then the board will shuffle.  You must click on a second cat that is different from the first.  As long as you continue to have a different image selected, you gain points. 

Once you select the same image twice in a row, you will lose.  

Compare your score to the top score. 

*The top score will only be held during the time the browser is open.*
